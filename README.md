# Temperature-based_Fan_Control
This project demonstrates a fan control system that automatically activates based on ambient temperature readings. The system uses an Arduino microcontroller, an LCD for temperature display, and a relay module to control a fan.

Features
Measures ambient temperature using an analog sensor.
Displays real-time temperature readings on an LCD.
Activates or deactivates a fan based on a configurable temperature threshold.
Smooth and accurate temperature readings with averaging over multiple samples.
